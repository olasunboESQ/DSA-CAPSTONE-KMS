As Business Intelligent Analyst employeed to suport the Abuja branch of the Store, the first step i took after being handed the

## Project Overiew

This is an Order Data from year 2009-2012, I am tasked with analyzing the Order Inventory of the store for 4 years.
I will use Structured Query Language to explore this Order Data in order to solve two (2) case scenarios.
The first critical step is to create a database unto which i imported the Order data of the store. 


 ## Analysis Tools

üìÅ - Structured Query Language. I am using this in the SQL Server Management [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)

## Outcome Of Order Data Using Structured Query Language

  üëã - Case Scenario One

I created a database called DSA_Project and i imported the excel order data into it as a table

 #### 1. Which product category had the highest sales?

 ```sql
SELECT TOP 1 PRODUCT_CATEGORY, 
SUM (SALES) AS TOTAL_SALES
FROM [dbo].[KMS Sql Case Study]
GROUP BY PRODUCT_CATEGORY
ORDER BY TOTAL_SALES ASC

```

Q1.csv‚Ä¶]()

         
#### 2. What are the Top 3 and Bottom 3 regions in terms of sales?

```sql
SELECT TOP 3
REGION, SUM (SALES) AS
TOTAL_SALES FROM [dbo].[KMS Sql Case Study]
GROUP BY REGION 
ORDER BY TOTAL_SALES ASC

```

- [West,3597550
Ontario,3063221

#### 11. If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method and Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive one,do you think
####     the company appropriately spent shipping costs based on the Order Priority? Explain your answer.

```sql
select ship_mode,
 order_priority, 
 count (*) as order_count,
 ROUND(avg(shipping_cost),2) as avgshipcost
 from[dbo].[KMS Sql Case Study]
 group by ship_mode, Order_Priority
 order by Order_Priority,avgshipcost asc

```
- [q11.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21033786/q11.csv)


- There is a significant inconstitencies in the alignment between priority order and shipping mode. The company did not appropriately spend shipping costs based on the order priority as some shippingmodes do not match urgency for some critical orders.


## FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.

- Generally speaking the Kultra Mega Stores order data for 2009-2012 showed that some customers ordered more overtime while some did not.

- Also some customer Segment thrived more than orders based on the product/services purchased and profit made.

- The company can do more in the area of advertisment, complementary gifts or raffle draw promos to boost their sales overtime.

- There is also need to align shipping mode with the order priority to improve the profit base margin. This will aslo curb unnecessary cost inflation of shipping cost.

- Strategic improvement in shipping decision can result in cost saving and improved service reliability.
